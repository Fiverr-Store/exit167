          <p class="eplus-nccjjF"> Thousands of dog owners everywhere are realizing now that THIS has been the cause of their
            dog’s sensitive skin rashes, diarrhea, vomiting, hyperactivity, aggression, and more… </p>





          <h2 class="eplus-1IXJ9K"> It All Started With A Rash </h2>
          <p class="eplus-nccjjF">Donna, a 46 year old dog mom of 3 keeshonds, was noticing a nasty rash appearing on her youngest
            dog Molly. </p>
          <p class="eplus-nccjjF">
            Her other keeshonds had also suffered from similar skin conditions throughout the years. It turns out keeshonds are
            highly prone to allergic reactions just like labs, terriers, and retrievers.
          </p>



          <figure class="wp-block-image size-full eplus-f7Jgzy"><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="450"

              class="offer-link"></a></figure>

          <p class="eplus-23scjz">
            But the list of dog breeds with significant risk to allergic reactions is also <i>continuing to grow each year…</i>
            <strong><i>so is something other than genetics causing it?</i></strong>
          </p>


          <p class="eplus-ZWutEu">

            Donna asked a friend who was a vet tech at a local animal clinic what might be causing her dogs’ skin issues, and
            without hesitation her friend answered Donna with another question:

          </p>



          <p class="eplus-rjLMW5"> <strong> <i>“What kind of dog food are you feeding them?” </i> </strong></p>


          <p class="eplus-iJOpIs"> Donna had heard this question probably 1,000 times. </p>
          <p class="eplus-pdpl1J"> <i> AND she had probably switched dog food brands 1,000 times too. </i> </p>
          <p class="eplus-5HiIn2"> She was simply at the end of her rope trying different foods and wasting money, and was totally
            convinced that the food wasn’t the problem. </p>
          <p class="eplus-1cBOOB"> But since her vet tech friend insisted, Donna revealed that she had tried: </p>

          <ul class="eplus-e6nEDh">
            <li> Purina pro plan </li>
            <li> Royal Canin </li>
            <li> Hill’s Science Diet </li>
            <li> Blue Buffalo </li>
            <li> Nature’s Domain </li>
            <li>Merrick</li>
            <li> California Natural </li>
            <li> Natural Balance </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="eplus-GCpo5r"> But before Donna could even finish listing off these food brands her friend stopped her dead in
            her tracks: </p>

          <p> <strong>“You need to STOP giving your dogs ANY of those brands” </strong> </p>
          <figure class="wp-block-image size-full eplus-r93mN2"><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="450" src="img/cup.png"
              alt="" class="wp-image-220" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px"><a
              href="https://discover.thefarmersdog.com/impact_howitworks?clickId=yOKxo51gTxyNTgFUYoRGqWUNUkDV42zJA3TS1Y0&irgwc=1&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=p-cpc&utm_campaign=360374"
              class="offer-link"></a></figure>
          <p>
            It turns out that the FDA has linked most of these brands to an increasingly common food related illness called
            dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) which is a <strong>serious heart disease</strong> that can occur in dogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brands labeled “grain-free” were most often linked to DCM, which was surprising to Donna because she had always
            believed that grain shouldn’t be part of a dog’s diet.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it turns out that “grain free” was really just a sneaky marketing tactic, and the <strong>grain was replaced with
              even
              more hazardous ingredients</strong> including peas, lentils, legumes, and potatoes, which are linked to DCM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donna had only been concerned with her dog Molly’s skin allergy, and had no idea about the risk of DCM from poor
            quality dog food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plus, the fact that “expert recommended” and overly expensive brands like purina and royal canin contain unhealthy
            ingredients like corn, hydrolyzed animal protein, and animal by-products only added to Donna’s distrust.
          </p>



          <h2 class="eplus-cszkvq">What’s Worse Than Chocolate?</h2>

          <figure class="wp-block-image size-full eplus-r93mN2"><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="450" src="img/dog-bg.png"

              class="offer-link"></a></figure>
          <p class="eplus-hs1Y4s">
            Many dog owners know that chocolate is highly toxic to dogs as it contains theobromine which cannot be metabolized by
            dogs. But luckily most dog owners catch their dogs <i>before they eat a lot of it.</i>
          </p>


          <p class="eplus-eMrUoI"> But what your dogs DO <i>eat</i> a lot of is their <i>food</i>. </p>


          <p class="eplus-vSf6we">And when they’re fed the wrong brand of food every day, chronic illness can slowly and silently
            develop over time. </p>
          <p>
            This is exactly what Donna was afraid of. She knew that if her dogs ever ate a dropped M&M on the floor they’d
            probably be fine. Or if her dogs were about to jump up on the counter to sneak a slice of chocolate birthday cake, she
            would catch them in the act…
          </p>
          <p>
            <i> …but she never really knew what she was feeding her dogs every day.</i> And she couldn’t stop any health problems
            from developing if she didn't even know about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The vet tech then handed Donna a pamphlet that listed the top 4 worst ingredients in dog food present in
              practically every brand available. </strong>
          </p>




          <figure class="wp-block-image size-full eplus-qG7ED0"><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="450" src="img/plate.png"

          <p>
            It didn’t matter if it was dry food, wet food, big brand, or boutique. Nearly every brand contained at least one of
            these 5 allergy aggravating ingredients:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>BHA</strong> - A toxic preservative used in dog food. Studies have shown that it’s a “reasonably
              anticipated” carcinogen that
              is linked to cancer and certain tumors
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meat By-Products</strong> - mystery meat of potentially bones, spleens, blood, brain, etc. that could also
              be sourced from
              diseased livestock or hasn’t been refrigerated
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> White Flour</strong> - Had been shown to drastically increase or decrease the blood sugar levels of dogs.
              It also only keeps
              them full for a short amount of time until they get hungry again, causing them to overeat
            </li>
            <li>
              Ethoxyquin - Many top brands use this poisonous preservative because it was deemed “safe to use at approved levels”
              by Iams. But what happens when your dog eats this every single day?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>“Grain-Free”</strong> - Dog food brands know that consumers are “catching on” about grain in their food, so
              they decided to
              promote “grain-free” food as a sneaky marketing tactic, while actually replacing the grain with peas, lentils, and
              legumes which have been linked to DCM
            </li>
          </ol>


          <h2 class="eplus-cszkvq"> Is Human-Grade Food The Answer? </h2>
          <figure class="wp-block-image size-full eplus-pCswNX"><img loading="lazy" width="760" height="450"

          <p>
            Donna was at a loss. She was sick of the marketing tactics and label tricks disguising these ingredients and putting
            her dogs’ health at risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her vet tech friend then suggested something that fixed a lot of other dogs’ allergy problems, which was to switch to
            either a <strong>lamb or tilapia based diet. </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            She noted that a lot of dogs that come into the clinic are found to be allergic to chicken, beef, or turkey, and that
            these other proteins seemed to do the trick.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Donna simply didn’t have the time or money to buy expensive ingredients and cook an entirely separate dinner each
            night for her dogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, Donna’s friend suggested the perfect solution:

            is cooked fresh and
            pre-portioned to make fresh healthy dog food easier than ever.
